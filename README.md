**Emotion-aware Dual Cross-Attentive Neural Network with Label Fusion for Stance Detection in Misinformative Social Media Content**

## ðŸ“„ Paper Abstract
Our paper proposes a novel approach to stance detection that incorporates emotion-aware dual cross-attention and label-aware fusion mechanisms. This model is designed specifically to handle misinformative content prevalent on social media platforms by leveraging both contextual and emotional signals from user-generated content.
